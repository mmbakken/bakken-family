          answer='The Sky Valley Chateau (AKA "The Lodge") is a 10-bedroom, 10-bathroom VRBO property that hosts smaller weddings and other events. It used to be a true bed-and-breakfast lodge, but was recently renovated and turned into a single rentable property.'

              We do not have a hotel block, but there are a variety of hotels in
              Steamboat Springs. For guests that are not staying at the lodge we
              are providing a shuttle to and from the venue for the ceremony and
              reception. This is a requirement of our contract with the venue,
              so please don't get us yelled at by the venue owners â€“ Hilary
              isn't a big rule-breaker. Please plan on taking the shuttle.

              Steamboat Springs directly, but it's more expensive and you're

            "Depends on the weather, traffic in Denver, where you're leaving from, I-70 traffic, construction, etc., but it's about 3 hours from DEN to the lodge in ideal conditions. You should give yourself 4 hours to be safe.",
            "There is a more scenic route through Rocky Mountain National Park, if you're coming from Denver, called Trail Ridge Road. We highly recommend doing this drive, but it takes some planning. I'd give yourself most of the day to complete the drive (6 hours or so) to accommodate traffic and stops for photos. You'll also need to get a timed entry permit for this.",
